# üè∫ CoDArchLab-ABM: Agent-based Modelling for Archaeologists

Welcome to the **CoDArchLab-ABM GitHub organisation**, home to the repositories and resources developed in the MA course
***Agent-based Modelling for Archaeologists: From Concept to Application and Publication***,
taught by **Andreas Angourakis** at [**CoDArchLab** (Cologne Digital Archaeology Laboratory)](https://archaeologie.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/institut/fachgebiete/archaeoinformatik/codarchlab).

This organisation provides a collaborative digital workspace where students learn to develop, version, and share simulation models as open, reproducible scientific projects.

## üéØ Course overview

Agent-based modelling (ABM) allows archaeologists to simulate past processes ‚Äî from settlement growth to trade, mobility, and social interaction ‚Äî as dynamic systems of autonomous agents.

This course trains students to:

* Design conceptual models of socio-ecological systems
* Implement models using **NetLogo**
* Use **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaboration
* Run simulation experiments and analyse results in **R**
* Publish models openly following **FAIR** and **Open Science** principles

## üß© Repository structure

Each student or group develops their own simulation project, following the shared workflow introduced in the course guide.

| Repository type      | Example name                                                                     | Description                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Template**         | [`project2025_template`](https://github.com/CoDArchLab-ABM/project2025_template) | Starting point for student projects         |
| **Student projects** | `project2025_<model-name>`                                                       | Individual or group simulation projects     |
| **Course materials** | `course_guide`, `course_slides`, ...                                             | Lecture notes and slides, datasets, and example models |

## üöÄ Getting started (for students)

1. **Join the organisation**
   Your instructor will invite you to the GitHub organisation via your registered email.

2. **Create your project repository**

   * Go to [project2025_template](https://github.com/CoDArchLab-ABM/project2025_template).
   * Click **‚ÄúUse this template‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúCreate a new repository.‚Äù**
   * Name it `project2025_<model-name>` (no spaces or special characters).
   * Set it to **Public**.
   * Add a short project description.

3. **Edit online or locally**

   * You can work fully in the browser (edit files directly).
   * If you have Git installed, clone the repository to your computer for local work.

4. **Document your work**

   * Fill out your `README.md` file (use the provided template).
   * Add your NetLogo model to `model/`.
   * Keep your notes in `docs/`.
   * Use `scripts/` and `results/` for analysis and output data.

5. **Publish your first release**

   * Connect your repository to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org).
   * Create release `v0.1` and update your README with the DOI badge.

## üß† Learning outcomes

By completing the course and maintaining your GitHub repository, you will learn to:

* Think of a simulation model as a **research software project**
* Apply **version control** and open-science workflows
* Integrate **NetLogo** and **R** for simulation and analysis
* Produce **reproducible, citable, and shareable** ABM research

---

## ü§ù Contributing and collaboration

Students and collaborators are encouraged to:

* Comment on and review each other‚Äôs repositories
* Report issues or suggestions using **GitHub Issues**
* Share general resources via `shared_resources` or `discussions`

> üí¨ Open, constructive feedback is part of the learning process ‚Äî treat repositories as living research notebooks.
